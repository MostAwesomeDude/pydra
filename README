Pydra
=====

Pydra is a Python framework for writing parallel and distributed programs. It
seeks to abstract the ideas of parallelization, simplifying the programming
work required for distributed computations.

For more documentation on how to use and develop applications for Pydra,
please see our website, http://pydra-project.osuosl.org/.
