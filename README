Pydra
=====

Pydra is a Python framework for writing parallel and distributed programs. It
seeks to abstract the ideas of parallelization, simplifying the programming
work required for distributed computations.

For more documentation on how to use and develop applications for Pydra,
please see our website, http://pydra-project.osuosl.org/.

Requirements
------------

Pydra depends upon Python 2.5, Twisted 9.0, and Django.

Installation
------------

Installation is relatively simple.

 #. Update paths in pydra/config.py if absolutely needed. By default,
    /etc/pydra is used for configuration.
 #. Run setup.py as root.
 #. Set ownership/groups appropriately for these folders:

    * config.RUNTIME
    * config.RUNTIME_FILES_DIR
    * config.LOGGING_DIR
 #. Update CONFIG_DIR/pydra_settings.py to contain your database information.
 #. Create the database tables with ``$ scripts/pydra_manage syncdb``
 #. Start pydra with ``$ scripts/pydra_master`` and ``$ scripts/pydra_node``

Notes:

 * This installer does not yet allow variable configuration of config paths
