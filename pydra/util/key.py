"""
Tools for automatic serialization and deserialization.

This module introduces two concepts: Keys and state. A class may be defined
as "keyable," meaning that its instances will have an attribute called "key,"
which may be used to recreate that instance at another run time, e.g. after
pickling and thawing.

Keys always have the following format:

(cls, children, args, kwargs, state)

~ cls is an identifier built from primitives that can be safely pickled.
~ children is a list of keyable args; see below.
~ args is the list of positional arguments given to __init__.
~ kwargs is the dict of keyword arguments given to __init__.
~ state is a class-definable primitive; see below.

If any of the original args of the instance are keyable, they will be
serialized in the key as well, in the children list. In order for this to
work, there is currently a restriction, as follows: Keyable args must come
before any non-keyable args if they are to be serialized.

If a class stores internal state in its instance, and wishes for that state
to be restored automatically upon reinstantiation, it may make available an
attribute called "state," which will automatically be saved and restored.
(For ease of use, it is highly recommended to use a property for the state
attribute.)
